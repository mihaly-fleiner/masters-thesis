# Thesis Project Repository

This repository contains the files and code developed and utilized during my Master's thesis project: "From Individuals to Collapse: Network Effects and Inequality in Agent-Based Models of Bank Runs" (Az egyénektől az összeomlásig: hálózati hatások és egyenlőtlenség ágensalapú bankcsődmodellekben).

As this repository is primarily for record-keeping in support of my thesis, the files are not organized for general external use.

If you are interested in any specific aspect of the project, the models, code, or results, please do not hesitate to contact me.
